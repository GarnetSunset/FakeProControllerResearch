# Knowledge and Research
Runs a modified version of the official JoyCon(?) firmware. Appears on switch as a Pro Controller, and on [the program from this repo, jc-toolkit](https://github.com/CTCaer/jc_toolkit)

Identifiers
======
Mac Address starts with: ``58:16:26`` which is the identifier for Avaya(?).

Serial Number for these units when connected to a switch or [jc-toolkit, as mentioned above](https://github.com/CTCaer/jc_toolkit) is ``0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF``.

Registers as a left joycon on jc-toolkit, which would explain the non-functional home-to-wake function. (Could also just be jctoolkit being unable to read what it is and falling to default)

Joycon/ProCon FW: 3.48
